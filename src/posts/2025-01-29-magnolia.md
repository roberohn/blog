## Magnolia

I'm a massive fan of Deafheaven and they're regularly in the top of my Apple Music Replay. Their new single Magnolia just dropped this week and it's a banger.
After 4 years they have a new album out due 28th March and I cannot wait for its release. If you're into shoegaze and metal check 'em out.

Volume up and buckle up!
